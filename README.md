# Hi there, I'm [Aysu] üëã

üë®‚Äçüíª Jr. Data Scientist at [AISTUDIO](https://www.aistudio.ai/)  

## About Me

I am a fourth-year student of Computer Engineering at Gazi University, enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering. My enthusiasm for software development is matched by my adeptness at its practical application. I completed my initial internship tenure at BITES Defense, spanning approximately one month, followed by a subsequent four-month summer internship at Z Software (Cubicl/Monkedo). These experiences afforded me the opportunity to cultivate proficiency in both online and in-person work environments, thus acquainting me with the dynamics of professional work culture.

During my tenure at Cubicl, I contributed to the backend team's efforts utilizing JavaScript and TypeScript. My responsibilities included the facilitation of API integrations and the development of components tailored to each endpoint within the project framework.

Presently, I am earnestly engaged in augmenting my skill set as a Junior Data Scientist at AISTUDIO. My objectives include mastering the utilization of SAS Viya tools, notably SAS Visual Analytics and SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning, alongside honing my proficiency in conducting data analysis and crafting visualizations through the SAS programming language.
